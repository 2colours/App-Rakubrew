rakubrew
========

rakubrew (called rakudobrew in a previous life) is a Raku installation
tool. It allows to have multiple versions of different Raku implementations
installed in parallel and switch between them. It's a perlbrew and
plenv look alike and supports both flavours of commands.

See <https://rakubrew.org/> for a more extensive introduction.
